-- INTERSECT and EXCEPT
--

SELECT q2 FROM int8_tbl INTERSECT SELECT q1 FROM int8_tbl ORDER BY 1;

SELECT q2 FROM int8_tbl INTERSECT ALL SELECT q1 FROM int8_tbl ORDER BY 1;

SELECT q2 FROM int8_tbl EXCEPT SELECT q1 FROM int8_tbl ORDER BY 1;

SELECT q2 FROM int8_tbl EXCEPT ALL SELECT q1 FROM int8_tbl ORDER BY 1;

SELECT q2 FROM int8_tbl EXCEPT ALL SELECT DISTINCT q1 FROM int8_tbl ORDER BY 1;

SELECT q1 FROM int8_tbl EXCEPT SELECT q2 FROM int8_tbl ORDER BY 1;

SELECT q1 FROM int8_tbl EXCEPT ALL SELECT q2 FROM int8_tbl ORDER BY 1;

SELECT q1 FROM int8_tbl EXCEPT ALL SELECT DISTINCT q2 FROM int8_tbl ORDER BY 1;

--
-- Mixed types
--

SELECT f1 FROM float8_tbl INTERSECT SELECT f1 FROM int4_tbl ORDER BY 1;

SELECT f1 FROM float8_tbl EXCEPT SELECT f1 FROM int4_tbl ORDER BY 1;

--
-- Operator precedence and (((((extra))))) parentheses
--

SELECT q1 FROM int8_tbl INTERSECT SELECT q2 FROM int8_tbl UNION ALL SELECT q2 FROM int8_tbl ORDER BY 1;

SELECT q1 FROM int8_tbl INTERSECT (((SELECT q2 FROM int8_tbl UNION ALL SELECT q2 FROM int8_tbl))) ORDER BY 1;

(((SELECT q1 FROM int8_tbl INTERSECT SELECT q2 FROM int8_tbl))) UNION ALL SELECT q2 FROM int8_tbl ORDER BY 1;

SELECT q1 FROM int8_tbl UNION ALL SELECT q2 FROM int8_tbl EXCEPT SELECT q1 FROM int8_tbl ORDER BY 1;

SELECT q1 FROM int8_tbl UNION ALL (((SELECT q2 FROM int8_tbl EXCEPT SELECT q1 FROM int8_tbl ORDER BY 1))) ORDER BY 1;

(((SELECT q1 FROM int8_tbl UNION ALL SELECT q2 FROM int8_tbl))) EXCEPT SELECT q1 FROM int8_tbl ORDER BY 1;

--
-- Subqueries with ORDER BY & LIMIT clauses
--

-- In this syntax, ORDER BY/LIMIT apply to the result of the EXCEPT
SELECT q1,q2 FROM int8_tbl EXCEPT SELECT q2,q1 FROM int8_tbl
ORDER BY q2,q1;

-- This should fail, because q2 isn't a name of an EXCEPT output column
SELECT q1 FROM int8_tbl EXCEPT SELECT q2 FROM int8_tbl ORDER BY q2 LIMIT 1;

-- But this should work:
SELECT q1 FROM int8_tbl EXCEPT (((SELECT q2 FROM int8_tbl ORDER BY q2 LIMIT 1)));

--
-- New syntaxes (7.1) permit new tests
--

(((((select * from int8_tbl  ORDER BY q1, q2)))));
